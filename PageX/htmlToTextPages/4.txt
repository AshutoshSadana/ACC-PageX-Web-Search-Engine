Please read up on the protection policy. Full protection is used to stop edit warring between multiple users or to prevent vandalism to high-risk templates; semi-protection and pending changes are usually used only to prevent IP and new user vandalism (see the rough guide to semi-protection); and move protection is used to stop pagemove revert wars. Extended confirmed protection is used where semi-protection has proved insufficient (see the rough guide to extended confirmed protection) After a page has been protected, the protection is listed in the page history and logs with a short description indicating why it was protected, and the article is listed on Special:Protectedpages. Further discussion should take place on the Talk page of the article. In the case of full protection due to edit warring, admins do not revert to specific versions of the page, except to get rid of obvious vandalism. Note: Editors should not consider requesting page protection as a method for continuing an argument from elsewhere nor as a venue for starting a new discussion regarding article content. If a request contains excessive argument, appears to be intended to resolve a content dispute, includes personal attacks or uncivil comments, or has any other unrelated discussion, it will be removed from this page and no action will be taken.

Protection does not seem to be needed anymore. (Admin who applied the protection is inactive.).

Second, the template and module are cascade protected which is why they are listed as full protected. The issue Zippybonzo points out is that these modules and templates are tempalte protected in addition to the cascaded full protection. @Primefac: you protected the module, so thought it would be worth asking you: is it worth upping these template protections to full protections in order to match the cascade protection level or should I just leave it alone? — Wug·a·po·des 21:40, 2 April 2022 (UTC)[reply] The module is transcluded on over 2 million pages, so it absolutely must be full-protected; even if it weren't cascade-protected from being transcluded on the Main Page, it would be under fprot, which I will now do. That being said, to answer your last question - if something gets cascade-protected normally, I do not think we need to match that protection unless it's something that will permanently be cascade-protected (like this module), because in all likelihood the cascade protection will eventually be removed.
